a = [1 , 2 , 3] #this is a list. it can append/insert/pop/remove a value, for example, a.insert(1,3)/a.append(1)/a.pop(1)
#list is a kind of data type that save the data base of computer while the searching speed is a litte low.

b = (1 , 2 , 3) #this is a tuple. tuple is a kind of data type that can't append/insert/pop a value.
#but, if a tuple contains a list, for example, b = (1 , 2 , [3 , 4 , 5]), the tuple can append/insert/pop value in b[3], but these functions still belong to list.

c = {'a':1 , 'b':2 , 'c':3} #this is a dict. a dict has a key and a value (key-value), and they are bound together.
#a dict can add/remove a key-value.
